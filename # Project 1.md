# Project 1
## Game Schematics
###### There will be a dealer and a bettor
###### The player will be the bettor
###### The dealer will be operated by computer using the Random function to choose card values from an array.
###### The way the cards are dealt wiil be stored as an Array.
###### Popping will be used to take out of the deck of cards.
###### Pushing will be used pushed into either the Dealer's or Bettor's hand, whomever's turn it is.
###### The deck will be reset after each hand or round is played.
## Basic Rules
###### There will be two cards given to both the Bettor and Dealer.
###### The Bettor will only see one of the two cards the Dealer has been given.
###### The goal is to get 21 without busting (going over 21).
###### The Bettor goes first with hitting or standing.
###### Hitting means that the Bettor will take another card.
###### Standing means that the Bettor will stop taking additional cards.
###### An ace will be either a one or an eleven (whichever benefits the player with that deck).
###### A 2-9 will count as the number is shown
###### A 10, K, Q, and J will all count as 10.
## Scoring
###### Whatever amount the player bets will be used as a temporary score (your money).
###### If the Bettor wins the round, he or she will take all the score he or she betted doubled.
###### For example, if the Bettor were to bet 200 points, then he or she would take back 400 points.
###### If the Bettor loses the round, he or she will lose the score, and have to bet again.
## Entering Numbers
###### Keypad will be used for the Bettor.
###### The Bettor will not be able to bet MORE than the amount of total score (money) he or she has.
###### ONLY INTS
