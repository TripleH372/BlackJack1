# Project 1
## Game Schematics
###### There will be a dealer and a bettor
###### The player will be the bettor
###### The dealer will be operated by computer using the Random function to choose card values from an array.
###### The way the cards are dealt wiil be stored as an Array.
###### Popping will be used to take out of the deck of cards.
###### Pushing will be used pushed into either the Dealer's or Bettor's hand, whomever's turn it is.
###### The deck will be reset after each hand or round is played.
## Basic Rules
###### There will be two cards given to both the Bettor and Dealer.
###### The Bettor will only see one of the two cards the Dealer has been given.
###### The goal is to get 21 without busting (going over 21).
###### The Bettor goes first with hitting or standing.
###### Hitting means that the Bettor will take another card.
###### Standing means that the Bettor will stop taking additional cards.
###### An ace will be either a one or an eleven (whichever benefits the player with that deck).
###### A 2-9 will count as the number is shown
###### A 10, K, Q, and J will all count as 10.
## Scoring
###### A wins, losses, and pushes score track will be kept.
